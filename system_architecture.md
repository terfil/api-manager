# API Management Service - System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a comprehensive API management service built with FastAPI and Scalar OpenAPI. The service provides functionality to manage service endpoints, visualize APIs, discover relationships between endpoints, and manage data model taxonomy.

## System Requirements

The system must fulfill the following core requirements:

1. **CRUD Operations for Service Endpoints**: Allow users to create, read, update, and delete service endpoints through various input methods including JSON files, YAML files, and Swagger documentation URLs.

2. **Scalar UI Integration**: Display endpoints, requests, and responses using Scalar's modern OpenAPI documentation interface, with built-in testing capabilities.

3. **Relationship Discovery**: Analyze and discover relationships among different endpoints, identifying common fields, differences, and data flow patterns.

4. **Data Model Taxonomy Management**: Provide a comprehensive system for categorizing and managing data models across different services.

## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework
- **FastAPI**: Chosen for its excellent OpenAPI integration, automatic API documentation generation, type hints support, and high performance
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and serialization
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database ORM and migrations
- **SQLite**: For development database (easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL)

### Frontend Integration
- **Scalar**: Modern OpenAPI documentation and testing interface
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For custom UI components

### Additional Libraries
- **PyYAML**: For YAML file parsing
- **requests**: For fetching remote OpenAPI specifications
- **jsonschema**: For JSON schema validation
- **networkx**: For relationship graph analysis

## System Architecture

Handles the core business logic for:
- Service registration and management
- Endpoint CRUD operations
- OpenAPI specification parsing and validation
- File upload and URL import functionality

#### 3. Relationship Discovery Engine
Analyzes API specifications to:
- Extract schema information from endpoints
- Compare request/response models across services
- Identify common fields and data patterns
- Generate relationship graphs and visualizations

#### 4. Taxonomy Management System
Provides structured organization of:
- Data model categorization
- Service grouping and tagging
- Hierarchical taxonomy structures
- Search and filtering capabilities

#### 5. Data Persistence Layer
SQLAlchemy-based models for:
- Service metadata storage
- Endpoint specifications
- Relationship mappings
- Taxonomy structures

### Database Schema Design

    version VARCHAR(50),
    base_url VARCHAR(500),
    openapi_spec JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Endpoints Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE endpoints (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    service_id INTEGER REFERENCES services(id),
    path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    method VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    summary TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    request_schema JSON,
    response_schema JSON,
    tags JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Data Models Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_models (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    schema JSON NOT NULL,
    service_id INTEGER REFERENCES services(id),
    taxonomy_id INTEGER REFERENCES taxonomies(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Taxonomies Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE taxonomies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    parent_id INTEGER REFERENCES taxonomies(id),
    description TEXT,
    level INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Relationships Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE relationships (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    source_endpoint_id INTEGER REFERENCES endpoints(id),
    target_endpoint_id INTEGER REFERENCES endpoints(id),
    relationship_type VARCHAR(50),
    common_fields JSON,
    similarity_score FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Design

### Core Endpoints

#### Service Management
- `POST /api/v1/services` - Create a new service
- `GET /api/v1/services` - List all services
- `GET /api/v1/services/{service_id}` - Get service details
- `PUT /api/v1/services/{service_id}` - Update service
- `DELETE /api/v1/services/{service_id}` - Delete service
- `POST /api/v1/services/import` - Import from JSON/YAML/URL

#### Endpoint Management
- `POST /api/v1/services/{service_id}/endpoints` - Add endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/services/{service_id}/endpoints` - List endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/endpoints/{endpoint_id}` - Get endpoint details
- `PUT /api/v1/endpoints/{endpoint_id}` - Update endpoint
- `DELETE /api/v1/endpoints/{endpoint_id}` - Delete endpoint

#### Relationship Discovery
- `GET /api/v1/relationships` - List all relationships
- `POST /api/v1/relationships/analyze` - Trigger relationship analysis

- `GET /api/v1/services/{service_id}/openapi.json` - Service-specific OpenAPI spec

## Data Flow Architecture

### Import Process Flow
1. User uploads JSON/YAML file or provides URL
2. System validates the OpenAPI specification format
3. Parser extracts service metadata, endpoints, and schemas
4. Data is normalized and stored in database
5. Relationship analysis is triggered automatically
6. Taxonomy suggestions are generated based on schema analysis

### Relationship Discovery Flow
1. System analyzes all endpoint schemas in database
2. Extracts field names, types, and structures from request/response models
3. Compares schemas using similarity algorithms
4. Identifies common fields, nested structures, and data patterns
5. Calculates similarity scores and relationship types
6. Stores relationship mappings for visualization

### Taxonomy Management Flow
1. Data models are extracted from endpoint schemas
2. System suggests taxonomy categories based on field patterns
3. Users can manually categorize models or accept suggestions
4. Hierarchical taxonomy structure is maintained
5. Search and filtering capabilities are provided based on taxonomy

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for API access
- Role-based access control for different user types
- API key management for external integrations

### Data Validation
- Strict input validation using Pydantic models
- OpenAPI specification validation before import
- SQL injection prevention through ORM usage
- File upload security with type and size restrictions

### CORS Configuration
- Configurable CORS settings for frontend integration
- Whitelist approach for allowed origins
- Secure headers for API responses

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Connection pooling for database access
- Query optimization for relationship discovery
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

### API Performance
- Async/await support in FastAPI for concurrent requests
- Response compression for large payloads
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Background tasks for heavy operations like relationship analysis

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless API design for easy horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling and optimization
- Caching layer (Redis) for session and frequently accessed data
- Load balancing support

### Data Growth Management
- Efficient storage of large OpenAPI specifications
- Archival strategies for old service versions
- Cleanup processes for orphaned relationships
- Monitoring and alerting for system health

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a comprehensive API management service that meets all the specified requirements while maintaining scalability, security, and performance.
